# Classify 

## Impact of the server hack

- Due to sudden AWS hack our model not able to run properly.
- We lost couple of important model tuning changes (such as epoch size, mapping between label and images, regularization parameter)
- But we are lucky that we did not loose our important data and classifier pipeline.

## Outcome

- Our model is able to classify the different cars
