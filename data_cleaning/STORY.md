# Data Cleaning

## Development motivation
- As the dataset contains car images and some trash images the first task was to clean the data.
- Also, we knew that ImageNet dataset cotains 5-6 car classes ranging from sports car, limousine, police car, taxi etc. so we can use these classes to first separate the car and non-car images.

## Impact of the server hack
- Server was hacked when the cleaning was already running and about 10,000 images were already cleaned.
- After that, all the cleaned data was deleted, code was also deleted and we had to restart by rewriting the code.
- We started the final script at 11 pm again.
- All in all we lost more than half a day due to hack.
