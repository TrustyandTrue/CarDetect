# Story of development

## Minor milestones:
* We first needed to chose a framework to work in. NodeJS seemed the most viable solution based on the overall present skills. 
* Next step was to create a simple user interface where the user can upload an image
* The image had to be then processed and fed into a Python Script running in background
* Last, the output and the iamge where shown in the browser

## Future
* Split code into multiple files
* Better functionality of UX
* Beauty enhamcenets of the UX
